# [Reworked Cargo Scooter](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2876081205)

Reworks the Cargo Scooter item to only have 2 slots, however these slots can hold crates, diving suits and ammo boxes. This mod is intended to be used in either singleplayer or low player count multiplayer lobbies to make looting wrecks, pirate submarines and beacons faster where in singleplayer it would be tedious and take a long amount of time to loot.
